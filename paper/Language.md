# Language and Vocabulary

Language barriers limit collaboration in decentralized communities, like Catalyst, that span the  globe.
These barriers don't only exist between different languages, but also between speakers of the same language who have differing definitions of words, or variations in commonly used vocabulary.

When language is acquired, a learner usually infers the meaning of a word or phrase from contextual cues. Common words have more context---and, as a result, retain their meaning better when passed from learner to learner over time.
Less commonly used vocabulary has a higher chance of changing in meaning between learners due to a lower level of contextual representation.
This doesn't only happen to single words in isolation.
Many grammatical structures in any given language stem from words fusing over the course of many generations of speakers.
This is nothing more than a natural result of the lossy process of language transmission over time, and the result is the linguistic diversity found across the globe.

The standardization of vocabularies through recording definitions in dictionaries decreases the diversification of language over time, but increases the ability to maintain meaning between collaborating speakers, as well as understanding records from past generations.
Languages with written records tend to preserve their structure over longer periods of time, while completely oral languages may transform dramatically over a hand-full of generations.

The important thing to take away from this discussion is that language is a lot more flexible than we perceive it to be.
This shouldn't be surprising since the flexibility of language is causally linked to the longevity of its speakers and the generational gap.
The way that people of a given generation speak differently than their grandparents is a small snapshot of this process.

### FIXME: Add Stuff

Here, we will be defining some terms in the most abstract way possible for the sake of giving them the most general scope of application.

## Definitions

 * **Culture** : Shared language, behavior, and/or motivations between two or more people.
 * **Language** : Patterns of thought propagated through some medium of exchange from one person to one or more others.
 * **Communication** : When language between different members of a group overlap enough for thoughts to be sufficiently conveyed.
